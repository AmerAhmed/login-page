# login-page

Training to create a login page that meets specific criteria (available in README)

Requirements specification:

The page should have a menu that contains two input fields, name and password, as well as a button for logging in.

2. Names and passwords must be hard-coded variables in your javascript and be: name = "test", password = "1234".

If you enter the correct name and password, you will be greeted by a new page that welcomes you to the page.

4. If you enter the wrong password, you will be greeted by a new page that informs that it has gone wrong.

5.The project must only contain two files (optional to use an external css file, style.css but no more html files.), Index.html and script.js so all views must be drawn on index.html.

6. Save a logged in user in localStorage so that I can close the web page and still be logged in when I open the page again.

7. In the welcome page (which is displayed when I am logged in) there should be a "log out" button that empties storage and logs me out.

8. The task must be solved without using the location.reload () function. It runs counter to our purpose here. We want to work with JavaScript, not against.

The task must also contain a description of the code's function and a reflection on the methods used to solve the task.
